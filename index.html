        <h2>Red Dead Redemption II</h2>
        <p>Red Dead Redemption is a 2018 action-adventure game
          developed and published by Rockstar Games.
          The game is the third entry in the Red Dead series and a prequel to the 2010 game
          Red Dead Redemption. The game's development lasted over eight years,
          beginning soon after Red Dead Redemption's release, and it became one of
          the most expensive video games ever made. It broke several records and had
          the second-biggest launch in the history of entertainment,
          generating US$725 million in sales from its opening weekend and exceeding the lifetime sales of Red Dead
          Redemption in two weeks.
          The game received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its story,
          characters, open world, graphics, music, and level of detail.</p>
